# ThatBannedChannel
Kodi Video Plugin for Watching Banned Content Creators, Documentaries, and videos

You will need to zip the file "plugin.video.That_Banned_Channel" in order to install from zip file. 
This is especially helpful for Kodi 19.1 on LibreELEC for Raspberry Pi which is one usecase I specifically
designed this for. Make sure you download the latest release of LibreELEC and get widevine installed. 
If you install the Crackle addon it will ask you to install widevine and that's how I know I got it 
installed.
Otherwise you can just place in the Kodi addons folder.
