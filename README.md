# ThatBannedChannel
Kodi Video Plugin for Watching Banned Content Creators, Documentaries, and videos

You will need to zip the file "plugin.video.That_Banned_Channel" in order to install from zip file. 
This is especially helpful for Kodi 19.1 on LibreELEC for Raspberry Pi which is one usecase I specifically
designed this for.
Otherwise you can just place in the Kodi addons folder.
